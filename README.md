# Rust DevContainer Project

This project demonstrates a Rust development environment set up using a DevContainer. By following the steps outlined in my Rust DevContainer tutorial, this project is configured for seamless development in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- **Pre-configured Rust environment**: Includes `rustc` and `cargo` for building, managing, and formatting Rust projects.
- **Integrated tooling**: The DevContainer is set up with all necessary dependencies for Rust development.
- **Ready-to-use workspace**: Simplifies onboarding and ensures consistent development environments.
